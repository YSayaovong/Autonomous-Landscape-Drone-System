Designed and simulated an autonomous landscape drone system capable of performing outdoor maintenance tasks such as trimming and spraying while navigating real-world terrain obstacles. Led the mechanical-systems integration effort by focusing on motion logic, stabilization requirements, and interaction between navigation control and physical dynamics.

• Developed autonomous navigation logic that accounted for motion constraints, terrain variation, and safe obstacle avoidance to support drone maneuvering in landscaping environments.

• Defined mechanical motion requirements (e.g., velocity, acceleration limits, turn radii) and integrated these into the control architecture to ensure feasible and safe traversal paths.

• Simulated system behavior in Python, demonstrating how motion planning, state transitions, and sensor input processing interact with a mechanical platform’s dynamics.

• Collaborated with multidisciplinary teammates on control logic, task automation, and safety constraints to deliver a coherent autonomous system concept.

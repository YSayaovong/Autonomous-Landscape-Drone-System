# Autonomous Landscape Drone System

## What I Did
I developed a Python-based simulation for an autonomous drone system capable of performing landscaping tasks such as trimming and spraying.

## Why I Did This Project
This project was a challenge to simulate real-world automation using Python. It allowed me to learn more about robotics algorithms and integrate sensors for efficient navigation.

## What I Accomplished
- Designed and simulated a drone system for landscaping operations.
- Gained knowledge about robotics and real-time obstacle detection.
- Improved problem-solving skills by creating a system that mimics real-world applications.

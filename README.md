## Project Overview

The Self Service Landscape Drones project aims to create an automated solution for landscape maintenance. The drones are equipped with advanced sensors and algorithms to navigate and perform landscaping tasks autonomously. The goal is to reduce the need for manual intervention in landscape maintenance, making the process more efficient and less time-consuming.

## Features

- **Automated Terrain Mapping**: The drones can map the landscape to identify areas that require maintenance.
- **Autonomous Operation**: Capable of performing tasks like mowing, trimming, and surveying without manual control.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy setup and operation through a user-friendly control system.
- **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance**: Equipped with sensors to detect and avoid obstacles during operation.
- **Battery Management**: Efficient battery usage and automated charging capabilities.


### Prerequisites

- A computer with an operating system that supports the required technologies (e.g., Python, ROS, etc.).
- Basic understanding of robotics and drone operation.
